- 👋 Hi, I’m @Trocoli, Currently on the 6th semester of my Computer Science degree, 2 more to go! 
- 👀 I’m very interested in Python, more specifically anything data related, and recently discovered a new passion for Django and Flask. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Machine learning, there's a world ahead of me but I look forward to it. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use data to make the world a better place.
